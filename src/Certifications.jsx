            I have completed an Advanced SQL Certificate, which deepened my
            understanding of complex database concepts and advanced query
            writing. Throughout this course, I gained expertise in subqueries,
            joins, window functions, CTEs (Common Table Expressions), and data
            optimization techniques. I learned how to design and manage complex
            database schemas, write efficient queries for large datasets, and
            optimize performance for faster query execution.
            <br />
            The certification enhanced my ability to work with transaction
            management, stored procedures, and triggers, as well as advanced
            data manipulation and analysis techniques. It has equipped me with
            the skills necessary to work with relational databases like MySQL,
            PostgreSQL, and Oracle, enabling me to build efficient, scalable
            database solutions and contribute to database-driven application
            development.

            I have completed an Intermediate SQL Certificate, which strengthened
            my skills in working with relational databases and querying data.
            This course covered essential topics such as SELECT statements,
            joins, grouping data, and aggregate functions. I also gained
            experience with subqueries, data filtering, and indexing, allowing
            me to write more complex and optimized queries for data retrieval
            and analysis.
            <br />
            The certification provided hands-on experience with designing
            database schemas, normalizing data, and creating efficient queries
            for medium-sized datasets. With this knowledge, I can now
            confidently manage and manipulate data, write optimized queries, and
            troubleshoot common SQL-related issues, making me proficient in
            leveraging SQL for real-world database management and application
            development.

            work with tables, columns, and rows, and how to efficiently retrieve
            and manipulate data using simple SQL commands.
            <br />
            The certification also introduced me to key SQL concepts like data
            types, primary and foreign keys, and simple aggregations. With this
            knowledge, I am equipped to write basic queries, manage data, and
            interact with relational databases effectively, making me
            well-prepared to handle foundational SQL tasks in application
            development.
